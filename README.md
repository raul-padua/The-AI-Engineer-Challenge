  <summary>🔥Setting Up for Vibe Coding Success </summary>

While it is a bit counter-intuitive to set things up before jumping into vibe-coding - it's important to remember that there exists a gradient betweeen AI-Assisted Development and Vibe-Coding. We're only reaching *slightly* into AI-Assisted Development for this challenge, but it's worth it!

1. Check out the rules in `.cursor/rules/` and add theme-ing information like colour schemes in `frontend-rule.mdc`! You can be as expressive as you'd like in these rules!
2. We're going to index some docs to make our application more likely to succeed. To do this - we're going to start with `CTRL+SHIFT+P` (or `CMD+SHIFT+P` on Mac) and we're going to type "custom doc" into the search bar.

3. We're then going to copy and paste `https://nextjs.org/docs` into the prompt.

4. We're then going to use the default configs to add these docs to our available and indexed documents.

5. After that - you will do the same with Vercel's documentation. After which you should see:

4. Run the frontend using the instructions Cursor provided. 

> NOTE: If you run into any errors, copy and paste them back into the Cursor chat window - and ask Cursor to fix them!

> NOTE: You have been provided with a backend in the `/api` folder - please ensure your Front End integrates with it!

3. Run the command:

     ```bash
     npm install -g vercel
     ```

4. Run the command:

     ```bash
     vercel
     ```
